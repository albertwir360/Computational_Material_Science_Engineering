1. Bash/Linux utilization for the Manipulation of Stock Data
2. Molecular Dynamics study with Quantum Espresso Simulation


## 1. Bash Project
Learned how to utilize bash shell scripting in order to manipulate csv stock data. The script allows the user to input a stock ticker as well as a month and year. In turn, a text file is produced with two columns representing the adjusted closing stock priced and date for every single day within the month. This project taught me how to utilize bash scripts to make otherwise tedious tasks easier.

## 2. Quantum Espresso Simulation
Quantum espresso is an open source software of code that enables the simulation of molecular dynamics in materials. In this project, we learn to utilize the library and edit inputs in order to draw conclusions about Aluminum under different conditions. The utilization of computer simulation enables the modeling of extremely small scale of Molecular Dyanmics
