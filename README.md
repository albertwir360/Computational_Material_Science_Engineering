## Micro Scale Simulation

1. Bash/Linux utilization for the Manipulation of Stock Data
2. Density Functional Theory study with Quantum Espresso Simulation
3. Molecular Dynamics Study with LAMMPS simultion 
4. Final Project



### 1. Bash Project
Learned how to utilize bash shell scripting in order to manipulate csv stock data. The script allows the user to input a stock ticker as well as a month and year. In turn, a text file is produced with two columns representing the adjusted closing stock price and date for every single day within the month. This project taught me how to utilize bash scripts to make otherwise tedious tasks easier.

### 2. Density Functional Theory Study with Quantum Espresso Simulation 
Quantum espresso is an open source software of code that enables the simulation of molecular dynamics in materials. In this project, we learn to utilize the library and edit inputs in order to draw conclusions about Aluminum under different conditions. The utilization of computer simulation enables the modeling of extremely small scale of Molecular Dyanmics 


### 3. Molecular Dynamics Study with LAMMPS Software
Molecular Dynamics is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movement of atoms and molecules by giving the atoms time to interact with each other before reflecting the change in the system. In this way, the molecules of entire systems can be evaluated as the system evolves. For this module, open source LAMMPS software is used to study Aluminum's molecular dynamics as both a shear load and tensile load is applied to the material.

### 4. Final Project
In this final project, I utilized LAMMPS open source simulation software in order to assess uniaxial compression in different materials. In this way, the short comings of the software can be compared to literature to analyze how the assumptions that the software makes can effect our overall end result.
