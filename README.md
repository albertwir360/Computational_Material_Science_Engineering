## Micro Scale Simulation

1. Bash/Linux utilization for the Manipulation of Stock Data
2. Density Functional Theory study with Quantum Espresso Simulation
3. Molecular Dynamics Study with LAMMPS simultion 
4. Final Project


### 1. Bash Project
Learned how to utilize bash shell scripting in order to manipulate csv stock data. The script allows the user to input a stock ticker as well as a month and year. In turn, a text file is produced with two columns representing the adjusted closing stock priced and date for every single day within the month.

### 2. Density Functional Theory Study with Quantum Espresso Simulation 
Denisty functional theory is a ccomputational quantum mechanical modelling method used in practice to investigate the structural magnetic and electronic properites of molecules, materials and defects. In this module, we learn to utilize open source software, Quantum Espresso, to obtain electronic metrics of aluminum. 

### 3. Molecular Dynamics Study with LAMMPS Software
Molecular Dynamics is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movement of atoms and molecules by giving the atoms time to interact with each other before reflecting the change in the system. In this way, the molecules of entire systems can be evaluated as the system evolves. For this module, open source LAMMPS software is used to study Aluminum's molecular dynamics as both a shear load and tensile load is applied to the material.

### 4. Final Project
In this final project, I utilized LAMMPS open source simulation software in order to assess uniaxial compression in different materials. In this way, the short comings of the software can be compared to literature to analyze how the assumptions that the software makes can effect our overall end result.
