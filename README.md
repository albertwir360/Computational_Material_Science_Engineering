1. Bash/Linux utilization for the Manipulation of Stock Data
2. Molecular Dynamics study with Quantum Espresso Simulation


## 1. Bash Project
Learned how to utilize bash shell scripting in order to manipulate csv stock data. The script allows the user to input a stock ticker as well as a month and year. In turn, a text file is produced with two columns representing the adjusted closing stock priced and date for every single day within the month.
